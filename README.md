# tic

Tic is a simple chat server implementation (mimicking Twitch Chat) made interesting by utilizing the [Orleans](https://dotnet.github.io/orleans/index.html) software framework. It is currently a work-in-progress while I learn and understand the framework. Expect more from this readme soon explaining the high level concepts, design decisions, and implementation details.
